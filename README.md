# Nick portfolio

## About my personal corner here on the internet
Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet. Nice of you to drop by and take a look.
This portfolio was made using my go-to technology stack, being React and CSS Modules in the frontend. I opted to not use a backend just yet as that is something I want to expand on with a headless CMS system in the (near) future.

You can find more about the things I've done so far, the projects I've made and the technologies I've worked with (at least the ones that matter ðŸ˜‰.


## My future topics and plans
You'll also find the topics and softwares I'm currently interested in. Feel free to take a look at them, maybe there's something interesting about them for you.
Very soon you'll be able to see and read about my favourite new technologies on my blog that I'm currently working on.
In case there are some topics or technologies you think may be interesting or fun to look at, feel free to reacht oout to me via my socials or my website.


## Questions
In case you have any questions, feel free to open an issue on Github or contact me through my website ðŸ™‚
