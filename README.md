# Nick portfolio

Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet. Nice of you to drop by and take a look.
This portfolio was made using my go-to technology stack, being React and CSS Modules in the frontend. I opted to not use a backend just yet as that is something I want to expand on with a headless CMS system in the (near) future.

You can find more about the things I've done so far, the projects I've made and the technologies I've worked with (at least the ones that matter ðŸ˜‰.
You'll also find the topics and softwares I'm currently interested in. Feel free to take a look at them, maybe there's something interesting about them for you.
