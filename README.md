# Nick portfolio

Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet. Nice of you to drop by and take a look.
This portfolio was made using my go-to technology stack, being React and CSS Modules in the frontend. I opted to not use a backend just yet as that is something I want to expand on with a headless CMS system in the (near) future.
